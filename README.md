# ðŸ§  Task Scheduler Agent

This is a simple AI-powered **task scheduler agent**.  
It reads tasks from a text file and uses the **Gemini API** to categorize them into three buckets:  
- High Priority  
- Medium Priority  
- Low Priority  

This was my **first basic agent project**, created to learn how to connect Python with an LLM, work with environment variables, and organize a small project.
